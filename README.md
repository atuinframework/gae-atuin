 - Image optimization
 - External libraries inclusion
 - Almost Everything managed by Gulp

 
## Development environment

#### What's required to execute it?

Just `docker-compose`.

To run local development environment:

```bash
docker-compose up
```


#### Docker containers

- **devenv** - Google CLoud SDK.
    
    - Run the local development server of GAE SDK 

- **tools** - Node.js & gulp tasks
    
    - To manage project's dependencies.
    - To handle project's static files (concatenate, minify and uglify).
    - To handle project's translations.
    - To prepare static files for deployment.


## Handle dependencies

When you run for the first time the GAE Atuin framework environment you have to install the python dependencies.
To do this, as the tasks to manage translations, you have to connect to the `atuin-tools` container.

1. With the development environment running, connect to the tools container.
```bash
docker exec -it gaeatuin_tools_1 sh
```
2. Then, use pip through the dedicated Gulp task to update them.
```bash
# To get the Gulp help
gulp

# Update dependecies
gulp update
```

Each time you will change the `requirements.txt` file remember also to run this update task.


## Translations

Flask-Babel is fully supported. [Official documentation]

#### To manage project translations:

1. With the development environment running, connect to the tools container.
```bash
docker exec -it gaeatuin_tools_1 sh
```
2. Many gulp tasks are available to extract, initialize, update and compile the project translated word.

```bash
# To get the Gulp help
gulp

# Manage translations
gulp translations[:extract|:update|:compile|:init]
```


## Deploy

### Before the deploy... don't forget to:

1. Check `app/config.py`
2. Check `app/version.py`
3. Check `app/app.yaml`
4. (Translation? Up to date?)
5. Minify, uglify and compress (production mode) the project's static files:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm atuin-tools gulp prepare-deploy
```

### Deploy through `google/cloud-sdk` container

Before you start you should have the `glcoud-config` container among your local containers.
It's required to let the `devenv` container authenticate to you Google Cloud console. [Reference here].

To create it:
```bash
docker run -t -i --name gcloud-config google/cloud-sdk gcloud init
```

then, simply enter in the `devenv` container:
```bash
docker run --rm -ti --volumes-from gcloud-config -v $PWD:/workspace google/cloud-sdk bash
```

and do the deploy through `gcloud` utility:
```bash
gcloud app deploy --project=<project-id> workspace/app/app.yaml
```


## Code conventions
 - `Admin` `_admin` at the end of name for admin variables
 - `.btnSave` `.btnNewWhatNew` `.normalContentCSSClass`
 - `form_nameofcontent.html` `modal_nameofcontent.html` the content type of the file is a prefix
